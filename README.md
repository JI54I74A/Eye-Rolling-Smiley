# Eye-Rolling-Smiley (Eye Exercise) ðŸ™‚

This is a fun work I created by adopting eye movement exercise codes of MITxPro fullstack course.
The eyes of smiley can move coordinately all the angles. Used JavaScript to achieve this feature.
The dynamic movements of eyse followed by mouse movement is developed by using JavaScript mouse 
event called `onmousemove`. This event triggeres when the mouse moves over an DOM element.

# How to Run

When the move moves the eyes of the smiley moves accordingly. No specific installations needed.
It's a pure JavaScript work and added some styling.

For getting the code and run it on the browser first need to fork it from my repo and clone the 
project to your local system. You can drag the index.html page on any browser to view the smiley 
face with rolling eyes.

# Roadmap

This eye rolling smiley can use for many purposes by adding more interactive features. In future I will
add more styling and also make the size of the smiley small.
